Analysis most frequently used Latex commands
==========================
    Finding commonly used latex commands for creating snippets and minimize keyboard layout changes while working 
    (For example, if you are working in a language other than English).

Intro
-------------

In my work with Latex I rarely use English. 
I think changing the layout for entering Latex commands slows down my work. To be more productive, I want to create snippets of the most commonly used  Latex commands.  

But first, I need to analyze my work and make a list of these commands. 

The purpose of this project is to search for these most used Latex commands based on the tex files, which I upload.
