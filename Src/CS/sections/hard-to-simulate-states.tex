\section{A use case for \limdds}
\label{sec:very-hard-states}

\newcommand\dicke[2]{\ket{D^{#1}_{#2}}}

In this section, we describe a family of quantum circuits we call ``Hamming weight-controlled circuits,'' which can be simulated in polynomial time using \limdds.
In contrast, we provide numerical evidence that the stabilizer rank of their output states grow rapidly in the number of qubits, indicating their hardness for stabilizer-rank-based simulation methods (see \autoref{sec:preliminaries}).

Given an $n$-qubit Clifford gate $C$, we define the $2n$-qubit Hamming weight-controlled Clifford gate (or HWC gate) $U_w^C$ on computational-basis states $\ket{x}, \ket{y}$ (both $n$ qubits) as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:hamming-weight-control-gate}
    U^C_w(\ket{x} \otimes \ket{y}) = \begin{cases}
        \ket{x} \otimes C\ket{y} & \text{if } |x|=w \\
        \ket{x} \otimes \ket{y} & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $|x|$ denotes the Hamming weight of bitstring $x$.
By Hamming weight-controlled Clifford (HWC) circuits,
we denote a sequence of HWC gates applied to initial state $\left(H\ket{0}\right)^{\otimes n}\otimes \ket{0}^{\otimes n}$.
\autoref{fig:weight-controlled-stabilizer-state}~(a) shows an example.
We refer to the output state as a HWC state.
%\todo{Tim: I removed the measurement part. I think it's safe to just talk about representation}


The \limdd representing a HWC state containing $t$ HWC gates has width $t+1\leq n+1$, and therefore has $\mathcal O(n^2)$ nodes.
\autoref{fig:weight-controlled-stabilizer-state}(b) shows an example.
%(i.e., including the \limdds that one builds during simulation of the circuit) 
First, the division of length-$n$ bitstrings depending on the Hamming weight is a known construction for BDDs~\cite{bryant86}, yielding a DD for the control register whose width which cannot exceed $n+1$. %the number of Hamming weights ${n \choose 2} = O(n^2)$.
%        \todo{are there any commonalities with the Weighted controlled ... hard functions for BDDs? Can we say something about those? Tim: @Lieuwe, you mentioned something about the top-register-DD representing a `triangle'? Is it worth adding that?}
The target register consists of a series of states $C_w \ket{0}^n$, each of which is a stabilizer state because $C_w$ is a Clifford operation.
Since Pauli-\limdds can represent $n$-qubit stabilizer states with $n$ nodes (\autoref{sec:exponential-separations}), the resulting \limdd for the entire HWC state has polynomially-many nodes.
To simulate this circuit, we build a \limdd for each individual Hamming weight-controlled Clifford gate in the Clifford circuits $C_w$.
These \limdds have polynomial size and look similar ot those in \autoref{fig:weight-controlled-stabilizer-state}.

%AL: I believe the simulation result, but don't see the proof (why wouldn't the NP-hardness of matrix x vector computation play a role?)

        \textbf{(a)} A ``Hamming weight-controlled Clifford circuit'' on $3+3$ qubits with input state $\ket{0}^{\otimes 3} \otimes \ket{0}^{\otimes 3}$. 
        The depicted circuit consists of three controlled-Clifford gates, where the Clifford $C_w$ is only applied if the Hamming weight of the control register equals $w$ see also eq.~\eqref{eq:hamming-weight-control-gate}.
        \textbf{(b)} A Pauli-\limdd for the output state of the circuit in (a), where the colored blocks represent Pauli-\limdds for the states $C_w \ket{0}^{\otimes 3}$.
        The edges which originate in the control-register-part of the \limdd point to the top node of three different branches, each representing a constant Hamming weight of the control qubits (edge weights are all $\id$; recall dashed/solid lines represent low/high edges).
        The branch in the target-register-part corresponding to Hamming weight $w$ represents the state $C_w \ket{0}^{\otimes 3}$, which is a stabilizer state.
        We note that stabilizer states are represented by a polynomially-large \limdd (see \autoref{sec:exponential-separations}) while the width of the control-register-part of the \limdd can never exceed the possible number of Hamming weights on length-$n$ bitstrings, i.e. ${n \choose 2} = O(n^2)$.
        Consequently, Pauli-\limdds represent all Hamming weight-controlled Clifford circuits using only polynomially-many nodes.

In order to investigate the hardness of HWC circuits for stabilizer rank methods, we employ the heuristic algorithm from \cite{bravyi2016trading} (explained in more detail in \cite{calpin2020exploring}) for searching for the stabilizer rank of Dicke states $\dicke{n}{w}$, which are equal superpositions of computational basis states with a given Hamming weight:
\[
    \dicke{n}{w} := \sum\limits_{\substack{x \in \{0, 1\}^n, \\|x| = w}} \ket{x}
    .
\]
To see that there exists HWC states $\ket{\phi}$ which have stabilizer rank $\chi(\ket{\phi})$ at least as large as the stabilizer rank $\chi(\dicke{n}{w})$of Dicke states, consider the HWC circuit consisting of the single gate $U_w^C$ where $C$ is the Pauli $X$ gate on the least significant qubit in the target register.
The resulting state is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dicke}
    \ket{\phi} =
    \sum_{k=0,k\ne w}^n \dicke{n}{k}\otimes \ket{0}^{\otimes n} + \dicke{n}{w}\ket{0\ldots 01}
\end{equation}
By measuring the target register in the computational basis, the resulting control register state is $\dicke{n}{w}$ upon obtaining output $\ket{0\ldots 01}$.
Since computational-basis measurements cannot increase the stabilizer rank, we find $\chi(\ket{\phi}) \geq \chi(\dicke{n}{w})$.

        Heuristically-found upper bounds on the stabilizer rank $\chi$ of Dicke states $\dicke nw$ (eq.~\eqref{eq:dicke}) using the heuristic algorithm from Bravyi et al. \cite{bravyi2016trading} (see main text for details).
        Empty cells indicate non-existing or not-investigated states.
        In particular, we have not investigated $w> \lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil$ since $\chi(\dicke{n}{w}) = \chi(\dicke{n}{n-w})$ because $X^{\otimes n} \dicke{n}{w} = \dicke{n}{n-w}$.
        For $\dicke{8}{3}$ and $\dicke{9}{5}$, we have run the heuristic algorithm to find sets of stabilizers up to size $11$ (theoretical upper bound) and $10$, respectively, but the algorithm has not found sets in which these two Dicke states could be decomposed.
        We emphasize that the algorithm is heuristic, so if there exists a stabilizer decomposition of a given rank, the algorithm might not find it.
    }
\end{table}

The heuristic algorithm follows a simulated-annealing approach: on input $n,w $ and $\chi$, it performs a random walk through sets of $\chi$ stabilizer states.
It starts with a random set $V$ of $\chi$ stabilizer states on $n$ qubits.
In a single `step', the algorithm picks one of these states $\ket{\psi} \in V$ at random, together with a random $n$-qubit Pauli operator $P$, and replaces the state $\ket{\psi}$ with $\ket{\psi'} := c(\id + P)\ket{\psi}$ with $c$ a normalization constant (or repeats if $\ket{\psi'} = 0$), yielding a new set $V'$.
The step is accepted with certainty if $F_V < F_{V'}$, where $F_V:= |\langle \dicke nw| \Pi_V \dicke{n}{w}|$ with $\Pi_V$ the projector on the subspace of the $n$-qubit Hilbert space spanned by the stabilizer states in $V$.
Otherwise, it is accepted with probability $\exp(-\beta (F_{V'} - F_V))$, where $\beta$ should be interpreted as the inverse temperature.
The algorithm terminates if it finds $F_V = 1$, implying that $\dicke{n}{w}$ can be written as linear combination of $V$, outputting the number $\chi$ as (upper bound to) the stabilizer rank.
For a fixed $\chi$, we use identical values to Bravyi et al. \cite{bravyi2016trading} and vary $\beta$ from $1$ to $4000$ in $100$ steps, performing $1000$ steps at each value of $\beta$.
%To determine the values of $\chi$ to investigate, we note the following two upper bounds to $\chi(\dicke{n}{w})$.
%First, following eq.~\eqref{eq:dicke}, $\dicke{n}{w}$ can be written as linear combination of ${n \choose w}$ computational-basis states so $\chi(\dicke{n}{w}) \leq {n \choose w}$.
%Second, $\dicke{n}{w} \propto \ket{0}\dicke{n-1}{w} + \ket{1}\dicke{n-1}{w-1}$, implying that we can use the sum of found upper bounds to the stabilizer ranks of $\dicke{n-1}{w}$ and $\dicke{n-1}{w-1}$ as an upper bound to $\chi(\dicke{n}{w})$.
%We ran the algorithm for $\chi$ ranging from $1$ up to the minimum of these two upper bounds.
See \cite{githubrepo} for our open-source implementation.

We provide the results of our numerical runs in \autoref{table:stabilizer-rank-search}.
Since our approach is based on using heuristic algorithms to find a good upper bound on the stabilizer rank, and not a lower bound, by construction we cannot guarantee any statement on the scaling of the rank itself.
Our approach could only have provided evidence that Dicke states do not have a rapidly scaling rank, thereby providing evidence that stabilizer-rank methods can simulate HWC states efficiently.
However, this is not what we observe, and our findings are consistent with the possibility that Dicke states have a superpolynomial rank.
Although further research is needed for a definitive answer, these numerics strengthen our confidence that \limdds can simulate HWC circuits faster than stabilizer-rank based methods.
